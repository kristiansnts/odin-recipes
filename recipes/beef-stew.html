    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>I love the green chilies in this beef stew, and the rich, flavorful sauce is wonderful! Serve over rice or with crusty bread and salad for a wonderful winter meal.</p>

        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano, crushed</li>

            <p>
                In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until hot, but not smoking. Pat beef dry with paper towels. Cook and stir beef in hot oil in batches until browned. Remove meat to a bowl with a slotted spoon; set aside.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Cook onions in drippings in the pot until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Return meat to the pot with any juices in the bowl. Add tomatoes with juice, chile peppers, beer, beef broth, oregano, cumin, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer, partially covered, until meat is tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes.

    </ol>
